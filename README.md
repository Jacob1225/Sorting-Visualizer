# Sorting Visualizer

This react project allows users to visualize different sorting algorithms. The sorting visualizer is a great tool to understand how the sorting algorithms function and their time complexities!

The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of the different sorting algorithms, while practicing react!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
